SUMMARY="An SDL port of xkobo, a addictive space shoot-em-up"
DESCRIPTION="Kobo  Deluxe  is  a  3'rd person scrolling 2D shooter with a simple and
responsive control system - which you'll need to  tackle  the  tons  of
enemy  ships  that shoot at you, chase you, circle around you shooting,
or even launch other ships at you, while you're trying to  destroy  the
labyrinth shaped bases. There are 50 action packed levels with smoothly
increasing difficulty,  and  different  combinations  of  enemies  that
require different tactics to be dealt with successfully.
